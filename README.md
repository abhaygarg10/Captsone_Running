## Background of Project
In India, farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country‚Äôs economic growth.There are many types of soils and climate all over the nation which makes it difficult for the farmers to decide which crop to cultivate. So, one part of our application is crop recommendation system in which the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop the user should grow. 
After choosing the crop, farmers now face the problem of selecting the type of fertilizer which would enhance the growth of the crop. So, the second part of our application is fertilizer recommendation application where the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements. 
Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid identification remains difficult in many regions due to the lack of the necessary infrastructure. So, the last part of our application is the plant disease prediction application where the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.
