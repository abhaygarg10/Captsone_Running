                        <b>The Nitrogen content of soil is high</b>
                    </div>
        <br/>
        Some suggestions to reduce Nitrogen content of soil:

        <br/><br/>1. <i>Add sawdust or fine woodchips to your soil</i> – the carbon in the sawdust/woodchips love nitrogen and will help absorb and soak up and excess nitrogen.

        <br/>2. <i>Plant heavy nitrogen feeding plants</i> – tomatoes, corn, broccoli, cabbage and spinach are examples of plants that thrive off nitrogen and will suck the nitrogen dry.

        <br/>3. <i>Water</i> – soaking your soil with water will help leach the nitrogen deeper into your soil, effectively leaving less for your plants to use.

        <br/>4. <i>Sugar</i> – Adding sugar to your soil can help potentially reduce the amount of nitrogen is your soil. Sugar is partially composed of carbon, an element which attracts and soaks up the nitrogen in the soil. This is similar concept to adding sawdust/woodchips which are high in carbon content.<br/><br/>

        <br/> 
        Some suggestions to increase Nitrogen content of soil:

        <br/><br/> 1. <i> Manure </i> – Adding manure is one of the simplest ways to amend your soil with nitrogen. Be careful as there are various types of manures with varying degrees of nitrogen.

        <br/> 2. <i>Coffee grinds </i> – Coffee grinds are considered a green compost material which is rich in nitrogen. Once the grounds break down, your soil will be fed with delicious, delicious nitrogen. An added benefit to including coffee grounds to your soil is while it will compost, it will also help provide increased drainage to your soil.

        <br/>3. <i>Plant nitrogen fixing plants</i> – Planting vegetables that are in Fabaceae family like peas, beans and soybeans have the ability to increase nitrogen in your soil

        <br/>4. <i>Spread grass clipping as mulch</i> - Apply grass clippings in your garden bed as an organic mulch. As the grass clippings decompose, they leech nitrogen back into your soil. <br/><br/>

                        <b>The Phosphorous value of soil is high</b>
                    </div>
        <br/> 
        Some suggestions to reduce Phosphorous content of soil:

        <br/><br/>1. <i>Avoid adding manure</i> – Manure contains many key nutrients for your soil but typically including high levels of phosphorous. Limiting the addition of manure will help reduce phosphorus being added.

        <br/>2. <i>Use only phosphorus-free fertilizer</i> – If you can limit the amount of phosphorous added to your soil, you can let the plants use the existing phosphorus while still providing other key nutrients such as Nitrogen and Potassium. Find a fertilizer with numbers such as 10-0-10, where the zero represents no phosphorous.

        <br/>3. <i>Water your soil</i> – Soaking your soil liberally will aid in driving phosphorous out of the soil.

        <br/>4. Plant nitrogen fixing vegetables to increase nitrogen without increasing phosphorous (like beans and peas).

        <br/>5. Use crop rotations to decrease high phosphorous levels.<br/><br/>

        Some suggestions to increase Phosphorous content of soil:

        <br/><br/>1. <i>Bone meal</i> – A fast acting source that is made from ground animal bones which is rich in phosphorous.

        <br/>2. <i>Phosphorus Fertilizers</i> – Applying a fertilizer with a high phosphorous content in the NPK ratio (example: 10-20-10, 20 being phosphorous percentage).

        <br/>3. <i>Organic compost</i> – Adding quality organic compost to your soil will help increase phosphorous content.

        <br/>4. <i>Clay soil</i> – Introducing clay particles into your soil can help retain & fix phosphorus deficiencies.

        <br/>5. <i>Ensure proper soil pH</i> – Having a pH in the 6.0 to 7.0 range has been scientifically proven to have the optimal phosphorus uptake in plants.

        <br/>6. If soil pH is low, add lime or potassium carbonate to the soil as fertilizers. Pure calcium carbonate is very effective in increasing the pH value of the soil.

        <br/>7. If soil pH is high, addition of appreciable amount of organic matter will help acidify the soil. Application of acidifying fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, can help lower soil pH.<br/><br/>

                        <b>The Potassium value of soil is high</b>
                    </div>
        <br/> 
        Some suggestions to reduce Potassium content of soil:

        <br/><br/>1. <i>Loosen the soil</i> deeply with a shovel, and water thoroughly to dissolve water-soluble potassium. Allow the soil to fully dry, and repeat digging and watering the soil two or three more times.

        <br/>2. <i>Sift the soil</i>, and remove as many rocks as possible. This will prevent minerals in rocks, such as feldspar and mica, from releasing potassium into the soil.

        <br/>3. Stop applying potassium-rich commercial fertilizer. Apply only commercial fertilizer that has a '0' in the final number field. The last number stands for potassium. Another option is to stop using commercial fertilizers all together and to begin using only organic matter to enrich the soil.

        <br/>4. Mix crushed eggshells, crushed seashells, wood ash or soft rock phosphate to the soil to add calcium. Mix in up to 10 percent of organic compost to help amend and balance the soil.

        <br/>5. Use NPK fertilizers with low K levels and organic fertilizers since they have low NPK values.

        <br/>6. Grow a cover crop of legumes that will fix nitrogen in the soil. This practice will meet the soil’s needs for nitrogen without increasing phosphorus or potassium.

        <br/>3. Try Sul-Po-Mag - Also called sulfate of potash-magnesia. It’s best to use it if a soil test reveals your soil is low in both potassium and magnesium.
        <br/>4. Beef up your compost with banana peels - To increase your compost's potassium content, add fruit and vegetable waste to the pile. Banana peels are your best bet.
        <br/>5. Use Potash fertilizers since they contain high values potassium. <br/><br/>"""
